# Optical-flow-UAV-avoidance

## Project Overview
The project based at California State Polytechnic University Pomona headed by Dr.Subodh Bhandari a Professor in Aerospace Engineering.
This particular project is using Optical Flow to create an algorithm to assist in Collision Avoidance. It is an interdisciplinary team of current 
Cal Poly Students that are currently working on the project.

## Goal
The goal of this current project is to develop a fully functional program capable of autonomous flight through the use of Stereo Camera Vision
and Optical Flow to detect and Avoid Objects. The success of this project will offer a cheaper method to help create autonomous flight as other 
methods that have been proven more effective are shown to be astronomically more expensive.



## Code Style
This project is using the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style for it's coding style.

## Tech/Frameworks used
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)
